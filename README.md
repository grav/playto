### playto

playto - OSX command line tool for playing an audio file to a certain audio device

Usage: 

    playto filename [output device name].

Ex: 

    playto /path/to/foo.mp3 My\ Nice\ Sound\ Card

#### Motivation

I fought long and hard to get either VLC and MPlayer to output to a certain audio device, but eventually I gave up and wrote my own audio player.

#### Credits

The code is forked from the Chapter 7 example in the book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Core-Audio-Hands-On-Programming/dp/0321636848'>Learning Core Audio</a>.
